How to solve:

1.Character Mapping:
Create a map where keys represent certain characters (e.g., letters or symbols) and values are the corresponding ASCII art for those characters.
Use loops to iterate through the characters of a string and print the associated ASCII art for each character.

2.Line-by-Line Mapping:
Break down the ASCII art into lines.
Use a map where keys are line numbers, and values are the corresponding lines of ASCII art.
Iterate through the lines and print them in order.

3.Custom Function Mapping:
Define custom functions for each ASCII art pattern.
Create a map where keys are function names, and values are the corresponding functions.
Use the map to call the appropriate function based on the desired ASCII art.

4.Dynamic Sizing:
Allow dynamic sizing of ASCII art based on user input.
Use a map to store different sizes of ASCII art for a specific pattern.
Let the user choose the size, and retrieve the appropriate ASCII art from the map.

5.Colorful ASCII Art:
Create a map where keys represent colors, and values are ASCII art with the specified color.
Use ANSI escape codes for color in the terminal to enhance the visual appeal.

6.ASCII Art Animation:
Develop a map where keys are animation frames, and values are corresponding ASCII art frames.
Implement a function to play the animation by iterating through the frames.

7.Conditional Mapping:
Utilize a map where keys represent conditions or states, and values are ASCII art for each condition.
Based on certain conditions or states in your program, print the corresponding ASCII art.
Remember, these are just ideas to guide you in creating a structured and flexible system for printing ASCII art using map functions in Go. You can adapt and combine these concepts based on your specific requirements and preferences.

func MapCharacters

1. Define the MapCharacters function signature:
Decide on the parameters the function will take. In this case, the function doesn't take any external parameters; it reads from the "standard.txt" file.

2. Create a map to store character mappings:
Use make to create a map where keys are Unicode characters (runes) and values are of type ascii (an array of strings representing ASCII art).

3. Read the content of "standard.txt" file:
Use os.ReadFile to read the content of the "standard.txt" file into a variable called file. Handle any errors that may occur during file reading.

4. Remove carriage return characters:
Replace carriage return characters (\r) in the file content with an empty string. This step is often done for Windows compatibility.

5. Create a scanner to read lines from the file:
Use bufio.NewScanner to create a scanner that reads lines from the content of the file. This prepares a scanner to iterate through the lines of the file content.

6. Initialize variables for tracking the current character and ASCII representation:
Create variables currentChar and currentAscii to keep track of the current character being processed and its ASCII representation.

7. Iterate through lines using the scanner:
Use a for loop with scanner.Scan() to iterate through each line in the file content.

8. Handle errors during scanning:
Check for errors using scanner.Err() and handle them appropriately.

9. Check for empty lines and update the character map:
Inside the loop, check if the line is empty. If it is, it means the ASCII representation for the current character is complete. Store the ASCII representation in the map and reset the variables for the next character.

10. Update the current character and ASCII representation:
If the line is not empty, update the current character and append the line to the corresponding element of the currentAscii array.

11. Update the current character and ASCII representation:
If the line is not empty, update the current character and append the line to the corresponding element of the currentAscii array.

12. Handle errors during scanning after the loop:
After the loop, check for errors one more time and handle them if any.

13. Return the character map:
Finally, return the populated character map.

func PrintAscii

1.Define the PrintAscii function signature:

Decide on the parameters the function will take. For example, it might take a map[rune]ascii (the character map) and the string that you want to print in ASCII art.

2.Iterate through the input string:

Use a loop to iterate through each character in the input string.

3.Print the ASCII art for each character:

For each character, retrieve its ASCII art from the character map and print it.

4.Handle characters not in the map:
Check if the character is in the map before attempting to print its ASCII art. If the character is not in the map, you might print an error message or a placeholder.

5.Formatting considerations:
Decide how you want to format the output. For example, you might print each line of ASCII art on a new line in the terminal.

6.Test the function:
Test the PrintAscii function with different input strings to ensure that it prints the ASCII art correctly.

7.Handle edge cases:
Consider how you want to handle edge cases, such as empty strings or strings with characters not in the map
