This is my math skills program. You can run it with the following command:

$ go run main.go sample.txt

I have included a sample.txt file where I have performed my own calculations for testing purposes. 
Unfortunately, I encountered difficulties in creating a test file in the audits repository 
using my macOS. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me 
via Discord direct message at rainpraks.
